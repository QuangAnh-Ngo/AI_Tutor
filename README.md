## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

To get the project up and running, please ensure you have the required tools installed and follow the steps below.
### **Prerequisites**

To build and run this project, you need to have the following tools installed on your local machine:

| Tool         | Version / Note                                |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **Git**         | For cloning and managing the source code.     |
| **Java JDK**    | Version 21 or later.                          |
| **Maven**       | Version 3.8 or later.                         |
| **Node.js**     | Version 18 or later (which includes npm).     |
| **Docker**      | The latest version of Docker Desktop.         |

### **Background Services**

This project relies on the following services, which are automatically managed by `docker-compose`. You do not need to install them separately.

| Service      | Description                               |
| :----------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| **PostgreSQL** | Relational database for storing metadata. |
| **ChromaDB**   | Vector database for semantic search (RAG).|

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**

Open your terminal and run the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-tutor.git
cd ai-tutor
```
<!-- Replace 'your-username/ai-tutor.git' with your actual repository URL -->

### **Step 2: Configure Environment Variables**

The project uses a `.env` file to manage sensitive information.

1. Download the `.env` file (it's located in a security place!!) 
2.  **Important:** Add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being committed to GitHub.
    ```
    # .gitignore
    .env
    ```

### **Step 3: Launch Background Services (Databases)**

Make sure **Docker Desktop is running**, then open a terminal in the root directory and run the following command to start PostgreSQL and ChromaDB.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
This command will pull the necessary images and run the containers in detached mode.

### **Step 4: Run the Backend (Spring Boot)**

Open a **new terminal**, navigate to the `backend` directory, and use Maven to run the Spring Boot application.

```bash
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Wait until you see the "Started LearningAppApplication" message in the logs. The backend will be running at `http://localhost:8888`.

### **Step 5: Run the Frontend (Tauri)**

Open a **third terminal**, navigate to the `frontend` directory (you will need to create this directory and the Tauri project within it), install dependencies, and launch the application.

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies (only required the first time)
npm install

# Launch the desktop application
npm run tauri dev
```
A desktop window will appear, and you are ready to use the application!

## üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

This project uses a **Monorepo** architecture with clearly separated components:

-   **`/backend`**: Contains the Spring Boot application, which handles all heavy-lifting logic, including RAG, document parsing, and API provision.
-   **`/frontend`**: Contains the Tauri application (React/Vue/etc.), responsible for the user interface and experience.
-   **`docker-compose.yaml`**: Manages the background services like PostgreSQL and ChromaDB.
